## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
-The ideal user for this application is a full-stack web development student.
-Everyone wants to keep track of the newly learned vocabulary.
-The problem this app solves is that it allows users to keep track of new vocabulary, which can also be organized by language or technology.-


## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
-On the landing page, the app will use Google authentication to authorize users to access the web app.
-When a new vocabulary term is added, an object should be created and stored in my Firebase real-time database.
-The web app has the functionality to filter by technology and also by using its individually assigned buttons.
